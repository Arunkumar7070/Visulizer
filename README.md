# Visulizer
# Graph Traversal Visualizer

A simple Python application that visualizes graph traversal algorithms, specifically Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). The visualization is done using the `Tkinter` library for graphical rendering and interaction.

## Features

- **BFS Traversal**: Visualize how Breadth-First Search explores the graph level by level.
- **DFS Traversal**: Visualize how Depth-First Search explores the graph depth-wise.
- **Graphical Interface**: Built using the `Tkinter` library, it provides a canvas where nodes (vertices) and edges (connections) are rendered, and traversal is animated in real time.
- **Status Indicator**: Shows whether nodes are visited during traversal and indicates the completion of the algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need the following Python libraries:
- `Tkinter` (this is included by default with Python installations on most systems)

## Future Enhancements
- Allow dynamic input for graph creation.
- Add more traversal algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or A*.
- Improve exception handling.
